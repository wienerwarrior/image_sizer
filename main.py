Should I create a copy of the image, create a new folder and then save the edited images in the new folder?
Maybe just have that as an option.
TODO: Store images in an array or dict or tuple so that they can be looped over ie:
TODO: After resizing the image, get the name, and rename the image. EX rock_wall_08_ao_1k.png would become rock_wall_08_ao_256.png if I choose 256 as the scale.


TODO: Stretch goal --> add a simple GUI, image options, some option to fuck with tyler.
TODO: Add to PATH: adding the scriptâ€™s directory to your PATH environment variable allows you to run the script from anywhere.
TODO: Use File-like files to resize images in memory, and provide a ticker or loader or something fancy like...

||||||||||||||||||||| pipes to show loading
Program Exited in 3s after processing n images.
